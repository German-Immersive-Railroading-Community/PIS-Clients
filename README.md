# PIS-Clients
The OC clients of the Passenger-Information-System

## Template folder
Every file in the template folder, except for Test.lua, variables.lua.template and [json.lua](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua), are taken from the [OC Emulator](https://github.com/zenith391/OCEmu) or from the files ingame on the computers. These are just for autocomplete and some error checking while writing code and are not needed ingame, since they are native on every PC from OC.
