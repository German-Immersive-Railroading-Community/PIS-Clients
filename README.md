# PIS-Clients
The OC clients of the Passenger-Information-System

## Template folder
Every file in the template folder, except for Test.lua, variables.lua.template and [json.lua](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua), are taken from the [OC Emulator](https://github.com/zenith391/OCEmu) or from the files ingame on the computers. These are just for autocomplete and some error checking while writing code and are not needed ingame, since they are native on every PC from OC.

## URL formatting
The URL needs to be URL/URI encoded, otherwise the programm will fail because of an `Error 400 (Bad Request)`. Characters such as `ÃŸ` have to be encoded correctly. I recommend using an URL encoder such as [this one](https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/dev-tools/url-encoder-decoder).
